<p>"What is an archive?" is a seemingly simple question that started gnawing at us when we realized <a href="https://repositorydata.wordpress.com/2017/10/30/archival-repositories-wheres-the-data/">we needed better data</a> that transcended the large research libraries and archives represented in ArchiveGrid. Significant archival material resides outside of the stewardship of a typical institutional archive with dedicated professional staff. Reflecting on my own personal experience, I can think of several examples of "archives without archivists," which exist outside formal archives:</p>
<ul>
<li>A village public library with one box of transcribed oral histories from a community project...</li>
<li>Crates of zines kept in a local radical infoshop...</li>
<li>Marriage records kept in the priest's office of the local parish...</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are within formalized archives. Do they count as archives?</p>
<p>This question gets <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives">at the distinction</a> between archives as a body of records, and archives as physically-located spaces where one can go to access archival records. Since it is difficult to determine every place in the world that might have "archives, meaning a body of records" (and honestly we would probably get overwhelmed...<em>fast</em>, because what institution wouldn't meet this definition to some degree?) we are primarily concentrating on "archives as physically-located spaces."</p>
<p>This then begs a second question...what about archives that have material records that are not documents? As Shannon Mattern <a href="https://placesjournal.org/article/the-big-data-of-ice-rocks-soils-and-sediments/">recently demonstrated,</a> there are many spaces and institutions which have archives of dirt, ice, and rocks. We even recently learned of a <a href="http://www.uky.edu/KGS/news/workshop-society-american-archivists.php">Society of American Archivists workshop</a> that is happening at the Kentucky Geological Society's <a href="http://www.uky.edu/KGS/core_library/index.htm">Well-Sample and Core Library</a>. Now, all of those places certainly do have documentary records in the form of intake and catalog records about the materials. But the "stuff" of earthly elements are <em>the archives</em>.</p>
<p>As project research assistant Whitney Ray <a href="https://repositorydata.wordpress.com/2017/10/29/dear-archivist-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-cold-called-the-u-s-archival-community/">noted in her recent post</a>, our primary approach for this project is recursively identifying all relevant "archival organizations" and using that data for our data set. These by and large represent places that both self-identify as "archives" and hold archives that constitute some kind of human-createdÂ  documentary records, as opposed to natural-origin materials.</p>
<p>Trying to externally identify archival spaces that don't self-identify as such, or obtaining comprehensive data about natural-origin material archives was not part of our original plans. But these questions are now coming up for us on a regular basis. We're still describing our project as "creating a comprehensive list of archival repositories in the United States," but it's clear to us that we probably need to explain in our final documentation when we say "archival repositories," what we generally mean are "places identified as archives that contain documentary record archives."</p>
