<p>On April 26, I participated in the amazing Twitter conference organized by the Society of American Archivists' Preservation Section. Below is my presentation. If you'd like to see more of the conference (and believe me, you would!), search Twitter for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23prestc">#presTC</a> or visit the schedule <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/groups/preservation-section/prestc-final-schedule">here</a>.</p>
<p>Hi #PresTC! I’m the research assistant for the @archivists_org Foundation-funded project to identify, gather, standardize, and make publicly accessible #repodata. This presentation was developed with the grant leads, Ben Goldman and Eira Tansey. 1/<img class="  wp-image-147 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tweet11.jpg" alt="Tweet1" width="489" height="367" /></p>
<p>There’s no comprehensive dataset of repositories in the US, which puts the archival community at risk for the unevenly distributed effects of climate change. #presTC 2/<img class="  wp-image-148 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tweet2.jpg" alt="Tweet2" width="510" height="382" /></p>
<p>Our goal: find repository data. #presTC 3/<img class="  wp-image-149 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tweet3.jpg" alt="Tweet3" width="531" height="398" /></p>
<p>From August to December 2017, we contacted archival organizations, State Historical Records Advisory Boards, state archives, and regional groups. #presTC 4/<img class="  wp-image-150 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tweet4.jpg" alt="Tweet4" width="543" height="407" /></p>
<p>Data came in a variety of formats, including PDFs, links to archived websites, and lots of spreadsheets. Currently we have 16,326 clean entries #presTC 5/</p>
<p>We’re still processing data and hope to have every state represented in our final set. #presTC 6/<img class="  wp-image-153 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/completed-ishstates_2018-04-23.png" alt="Completed-ishStates_2018-04-23" width="544" height="361" /></p>
<p>Our findings show just how many archival repositories go under the radar. For example, we’ve identified 240 repositories in FL. In the original dataset, there were 22. #presTC 7/</p>

<p>[gallery ids="155,154" type="square" columns="2"]</p>
<p>Our “after” map includes both physical and mailing addresses (total of 243 data pts). That dot in the gulf? It’s actually a PO Box in the FL Keys. #presTC 8/<img class="  wp-image-152 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/repodata_2018_after_floridadata.jpg" alt="RepoData_2018_AFTER_FloridaData" width="509" height="301" /></p>
<p>While this set is still an approximate representation of #repodata, we hope that others can  repurpose it. The data can also be used to identify vulnerable repos when used w/ other climate change tools. #presTC 9/</p>

<p>To compare a single repository address with potential sea level rise and flood frequency, you can use the excellent sea-level rise viewer from @noaa: <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/slr/">https://coast.noaa.gov/slr/</a> #presTC 10/</p>
<p>Our work also confirms the suspicion that the universe of archives is much, much bigger than is typically acknowledged #presTC 11/<img class="  wp-image-151 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tweet111.jpg" alt="Tweet11" width="501" height="376" /></p>
<p>Many thanks to @archivists_org Foundation, @SAApreservation, and the archival groups who shared their data! To learn more, you can visit our blog: <a href="https://repositorydata.wordpress.com/">https://repositorydata.wordpress.com/</a> I’m around to answer questions through the week. #presTC 12/12</p>
