<p>Over the weeks and months we've been sharing details of our effort, we've received many inquiries from interested people asking questions like, "Is my archive represented in your data?" or "What repositories have you found for Florida?" or "When can I view the data you've collected?" We even had one inquiry from a private individual who was looking for a good historical society to donate material to! All of these inquiries have been welcome, and we're pleased to hear of any interest in our work. Now we'd like to begin the rollout of data, but some caveats are in order.</p>
<p>First, we're not yet done. This is a very preliminary and imperfect initial release. Consider this first phase a Beta release, which we are sharing in conjunction with a public presentation of our work at this year's <a href="http://conference.rbms.info/2018/session/seminar-climate-change-and-cultural-heritage-gathering-data-and-exploring-professional-implications-for-a-very-different-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RBMS Conference in New Orleans</a>. This first release includes data on approximately 12,000 repository locations from 30 states, plus the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Second, while many of the state data we're sharing represents the entirety of the data we <a href="https://repositorydata.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/a-deluge-of-data-our-mid-year-update/">gathered from our 100+ sources</a>, some of these states have additional sources that we have yet to incorporate. In all these cases, the unincorporated data is not structured or formatted in a way that lends itself to easy manipulation (for example, a list of organizations and their websites, which requires a fair amount of searching and browsing/cutting and pasting (oh, the glamorous data work!) to get into our spreadsheets).</p>
<p>We will happily share a larger set of data in the coming months as we wrap up other aspects of our work, and those releases will include additional information on our project. For now, if you'd like to review this initial release, you can visit our Github repository at: <a href="https://github.com/tanseyem/RepoData">https://github.com/tanseyem/RepoData</a>.Â While we welcome any corrections or additions you may be able to offer, we may not be able to address such feedback until after our remaining project work is done.</p>
