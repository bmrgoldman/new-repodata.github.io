<p>Hi! My name is Whitney, and I’m very excited to be the Research Assistant helping Ben and Eira with RepoData. Our goal is to create a standardized, centralized, and interoperable data set of archival repositories in the United States. We will use this data set to create a map that depicts possible effects of climate change on archival repositories and their particular vulnerabilities. My job is to gather information about the existence and location of archival repositories.</p>
<p>In early September I began to reach out to archival organizations. I used the <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/assoc-orgs/directory">Directory of Archival Organizations</a> on the website of the Society of American Archivists (SAA) and list of groups in the Regional Archivists Associations Consortium (RAACs). Using the most up-to-date contact information I could find, either on the SAA site or on the websites of the organizations, I emailed contacts for the archival organizations and RAACs. Since many overlapped, I used my best judgment in first contacting the overarching groups and then, if there appeared to be a gap in our data collection, the sub-groups.</p>
<p>I also began to reach out to state archivists from the <a href="https://www.statearchivists.org/connect/resources-state/">Directory of State Archives</a> and representatives from State Historical Records Advisory Boards (SHRABs). The two directories above formed the core of my outreach. However, I also reached out to groups that I found through either recommendation by the organizations or through links on their websites.</p>
<p>In total, I’ve contacted 111 archival groups and SHRAB affiliates. As a team, Ben, Eira, and I have collected information on about 18,000 repositories, although we suspect that a lot of these repositories are duplicate entries: more on this, and what we plan to do about it, in a different blog post.</p>
<p>For me, this has been a learning opportunity in outreach and research on the profession. (My apologies again to the archivist in Oklahoma City whom I emailed twice as representative for two organizations!) It’s been great to see how resourceful archivists are in getting the word out about their collections through affiliation with a group and through descriptive information on their websites.</p>
<p>Next I’ll normalize data fields, categorize repositories, and find latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. Our plan includes distinguishing between mailing addresses and the physical locations of repositories, particularly since mapping them can tell different stories about vulnerabilities to climate change.</p>
