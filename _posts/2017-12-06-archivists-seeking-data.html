<p>We have reached out to a seriously large number of archival organizations/societies/consortia since beginning this effort, and our data grows by the week. However, there are a number of organizations we have yet to hear from and our mental archival map of the United States still has some state-sized holes in it. In some cases, we've located older online directories, but have not been able to confirm how current they are.</p>
<p>Besides the vagaries of email spam filters, we can think of any number of reasons that these 8 or so organizations would not have had a chance to reach out to us, and we're mindful that archivists everywhere struggle for time and resources, while trying to meet the every day demands of their researchers and other stakeholders. BUT...</p>
<p><em>If you are involved in any of the following organizations, or are close buddies with someone who is, please reach out to us and help us put the finishing touches on this massive data collection effort! We'd really appreciate it.</em></p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Association of Tribal Archives, Libraries, and Museums</li>
<li>Conference of California Historical Societies</li>
<li>Friends of the D.C. Archives</li>
<li>Indiana State Historical Records Advisory Board/ Indiana Archives and Records Administration</li>
<li>L.A. as Subject (has a <a href="https://laassubject.org/directory/member-directory">directory online</a>, but haven't been able to connect)</li>
<li>North Carolina Museums Council</li>
<li>Portland Area Archives (has a list of <a href="https://portlandarchives.wordpress.com/local-archives-and-heritage-organizations/">local organizations online</a> but no listed contact information to confirm it's up to date)</li>
<li>Society of Indiana Archivists</li>
</ul>
