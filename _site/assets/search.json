        "excerpt": "Hi! My name is Whitney, and I’m very excited to be the Research Assistant helping Ben and Eira with RepoData. Our goal is to create a standardized, centralized, and interoperable data set of archival repositories in the United States. We will use this data set to create a map that depicts possible effects of climate change on archival repositories and their particular vulnerabilities. My job is to gather information about the existence and location of archival repositories.\nIn early September I began to reach out to archival organizations. I used the Directory of Archival Organizations on the website of the Society of American Archivists (SAA) and list of groups in the Regional Archivists Associations Consortium (RAACs). Using the most up-to-date contact information I could find, either on the SAA site or on the websites of the organizations, I emailed contacts for the archival organizations and RAACs. Since many overlapped, I used my best judgment in first contacting the overarching groups and then, if there appeared to be a gap in our data collection, the sub-groups.\nI also began to reach out to state archivists from the Directory of State Archives and representatives from State Historical Records Advisory Boards (SHRABs). The two directories above formed the core of my outreach. However, I also reached out to groups that I found through either recommendation by the organizations or through links on their websites.\nIn total, I’ve contacted 111 archival groups and SHRAB affiliates. As a team, Ben, Eira, and I have collected information on about 18,000 repositories, although we suspect that a lot of these repositories are duplicate entries: more on this, and what we plan to do about it, in a different blog post.\nFor me, this has been a learning opportunity in outreach and research on the profession. (My apologies again to the archivist in Oklahoma City whom I emailed twice as representative for two organizations!) It’s been great to see how resourceful archivists are in getting the word out about their collections through affiliation with a group and through descriptive information on their websites.\nNext I’ll normalize data fields, categorize repositories, and find latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. Our plan includes distinguishing between mailing addresses and the physical locations of repositories, particularly since mapping them can tell different stories about vulnerabilities to climate change.\nAuthored by Whitney Ray\n",

        "excerpt": "\"Where can we find a comprehensive list of archival repositories in the United States?\" This is a question Eira Tansey (University of Cincinnati) and I (Ben Goldman, Penn State University) asked in early 2016 when we started a project to map the vulnerabilities of American archives locations to the future impacts of climate change. With the amazing help of geospatialists at Penn State (Nathan Piekielek, Geospatial Services Librarian) and Tara Mazurczyk (Ph.D. Candidate, Department of Geography) we explored how sea level rise, storm surge, temperature fluctuations and increased precipitation might effect 1,232 archival locations in the continental United States. Eira and I shared initial findings at the Research Forum of the 2017 Society of American Archivists' Annual Conference, and submitted (with our collaborators) a manuscript for publication this past July.\nWhile we are excited to share the results of this project with our archival colleagues and comrades, one of our lingering disappointments with this effort has been the lack of a comprehensive dataset to work with. The best option we could find came from OCLC's ArchiveGrid (thanks to Bruce Washburn and Merrilee Proffit), which provided a useful dataset to conduct our research, but clearly did not fully reflect the size of the archival community. By contrast, IMLS's Museum Universe data file contains over 30,000 entries. It became clear to us that in order to fully understand the future impacts of climate change on documentary heritage in the U.S., we needed better data.\nNow, thanks to the Society of American Archivists Foundation, we can begin to pull together a better dataset. Eira and I were awarded a $5,000 Strategic Growth grant from SAA Foundation in May, and over the course of one year (July 2017 - June 2018) are attempting to find, aggregate, standardize and openly share a vast dataset on archival repository locations, with help from an amazing Research Assistant, Whitney Ray.\nWe hope to use this blog to share our progress and highlight interesting or useful information related to this effort. We welcome the wisdom and comments of our archival colleagues everywhere, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any thoughts or ideas!\nAuthored by Ben Goldman\n",

        "excerpt": "\"What is an archive?\" is a seemingly simple question that started gnawing at us when we realized we needed better data that transcended the large research libraries and archives represented in ArchiveGrid. Significant archival material resides outside of the stewardship of a typical institutional archive with dedicated professional staff. Reflecting on my own personal experience, I can think of several examples of \"archives without archivists,\" which exist outside formal archives:\n\nA village public library with one box of transcribed oral histories from a community project...\nCrates of zines kept in a local radical infoshop...\nMarriage records kept in the priest's office of the local parish...\n\nNone of these are within formalized archives. Do they count as archives?\nThis question gets at the distinction between archives as a body of records, and archives as physically-located spaces where one can go to access archival records. Since it is difficult to determine every place in the world that might have \"archives, meaning a body of records\" (and honestly we would probably get overwhelmed...fast, because what institution wouldn't meet this definition to some degree?) we are primarily concentrating on \"archives as physically-located spaces.\"\nThis then begs a second question...what about archives that have material records that are not documents? As Shannon Mattern recently demonstrated, there are many spaces and institutions which have archives of dirt, ice, and rocks. We even recently learned of a Society of American Archivists workshop that is happening at the Kentucky Geological Society's Well-Sample and Core Library. Now, all of those places certainly do have documentary records in the form of intake and catalog records about the materials. But the \"stuff\" of earthly elements are the archives.\nAs project research assistant Whitney Ray noted in her recent post, our primary approach for this project is recursively identifying all relevant \"archival organizations\" and using that data for our data set. These by and large represent places that both self-identify as \"archives\" and hold archives that constitute some kind of human-created  documentary records, as opposed to natural-origin materials.\nTrying to externally identify archival spaces that don't self-identify as such, or obtaining comprehensive data about natural-origin material archives was not part of our original plans. But these questions are now coming up for us on a regular basis. We're still describing our project as \"creating a comprehensive list of archival repositories in the United States,\" but it's clear to us that we probably need to explain in our final documentation when we say \"archival repositories,\" what we generally mean are \"places identified as archives that contain documentary record archives.\"\nAuthored by Eira Tansey\n",

As many of you know, inclusion in ArchiveGrid is primarily driven by having various descriptive data (MARC records, EAD finding aids, etc) online and crawlable to OCLC. This means that repositories with professional archivists on staff and the resources to make archival description available online are over-represented in the ArchiveGrid data set. In reality, there are many archives that don't fit this description, and are therefore literally invisible to much of the profession.\nThis has been frustrating to us as we pursue our work on archival vulnerability to climate change. The institutions that are most at risk for sea-level rise and climate change influenced disasters are also the least likely to have professional staff and sufficient resources to sustain archival collections even in \"normal\" times - let alone during an emergency. And yet, these are the archives that weren't visible in our first pass at mapping repository vulnerability to climate change.\nBut now we'd like to show you the dramatic way in which our research project has uncovered how many archives exist - even if they aren't putting their finding aids online.\nThis is the \"Before\" map, reflecting OCLC's data - according to ArchiveGrid as of 2016, there are approximately 44 repositories in the state of Ohio:\n\nAlthough this data is not yet final, this is our beta data set for Ohio - i.e., our \"After\" map. You can see a dramatic difference in how many more archives have been revealed thanks to our efforts (and especially that of Whitney, our fantastic research assistant, who has done the heavy lifting in reaching out to archival organizations to compile and clean data). According to our preliminary* data, there are well over 500 repositories in the state of Ohio.\n\nI want to highlight that constructing archives as those repositories that participate in networked archival descriptive infrastructure tends to erase the visibility of small archives, especially those outside of major population centers. Let's use southeastern Ohio - aka Appalachia - as an example.\nThe light-green counties are those that are part of the federally-defined Appalachian Regional Commission's jurisdiction.

        "title": "Data Decisions",
        "excerpt": "Like many archivists, I have experienced the frustrations and satisfactions that attend the process of moving your institution's archival data from one system to another, which typically demands a reckoning with past descriptive practices (no judgment; practices evolve) and a better understanding of modern encoding and descriptive standards. My participation in such efforts has given me a deep respect for archivists who understands the ins and outs of these descriptive frameworks and encoding standards.\nAlas, I am not one of those archivists (**please keep this in mind as I try my best to explain below our understanding of archival data approaches). So in planning our grant, we spent some time consulting with standards documents and peer experts to ensure that the final dataset models repository locations data in a way that supports maintenance, reuse, and portability to other descriptive frameworks.\nCurrent archival descriptive practice seems somewhat inconclusive (or unemphatic, perhaps?) when it comes to encoding repository information. Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS) guidelines for encoding repository information are fairly remedial (see 2.2), suggesting only that an address and contact information may be \"desirable\". Section 5 of the International Standard for Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH) provides considerable guidance on describing a repository's name, parent institution, identifier, location, services, and mission. One noteworthy area of that section is 5.6 (Control Area), which suggests identifying the sources of your data and the dates of creation or revision (thanks to Mike Rush for pointing this out to us). ISDIAH, we learned, is now (or soon to be) considered superseded by the International Council on Archives' Records in Context (RiC), which treats repositories as Agents (corporate bodies). Aspects of ISDIAH have seemingly been translated to RiC's section 3, Properties of Entities -- specifically, 3.1 (for names and identifiers), 3.7 (for types of agents), 3.10 (for contact information) and 3.19 (\"Properties of Place\", which includes location information and even geographic coordinates.\nFor a real life example of how all this might translate to an Agent record in Encoded Archival Context (EAC), see below (thanks to Robbie Hott, who helpfully shared some data samples from the Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC) project):\n\nSomething not really addressed in these examples is the type of archival repository. As we've discussed, definitions of \"archive\" are hard to pin down, but it's something we've been trying to give attention to as we work through the data.\nBuilding on these descriptive approaches, we initially wanted to establish the following data on all repositories:\n\nRepository Name\nParent Institution Name\nAuthorized Name\nAuthorized Name Source\nRepository Identifier\nRepository Identifier Source\nLocation Type (e.g. Mailing Address, Street Address)\nStreet Address 1\nStreet Address 2\nCity\nState/Province\nZip Code\nCountry\nLongitude\nLatitude\nData Source\nDate of Entry\nName of Person Recording the Entry\n\nWe quickly realized that separately gathering authorized names and identifiers from a source like the Library of Congress's MARC organization codes would be too labor intensive. Longitude and latitude are absolutely critical pieces of data, but not something that was likely to be included in existing datasets. Instead of gathering that data now, our plan is auto-generate the geocoordinates using a service like Geocodio at the end of our project. We were also surprised (though probably should not have been) to discover that some data sources included both a mailing and street address for some repositories. In these cases, we have created two separate entries for the same repository, and created a new field in our data for \"location type\" to distinguish separate entries for the same repository.\n(Geocodio itself provides some interesting data considerations, including the concept of accuracy. For instance, it still generate coordinates for P.O. boxes, but encodes that location as a place rather than a point, and then provides an accuracy score. Geocodio also auto-generates county names, and normalizes address information, which will also come in handy for our project.)\nIn the end, our final dataset should bring together the name and location elements we've described here, aggregated into a single CSV file, which should lend itself to being migrated to other formats and integrated into other systems as needed. We'll also make the final data accessible through an Open Science Framework or Github repository so that others can continue the work we've begun. Other data sources will come to light, or repositories themselves may potentially find errors in our data that require updating. Ongoing maintenance will be required, which is why we hope this data can be stewarded by SAA once we're done.

My participation in such efforts has given me a deep respect for archivists who understands the ins and outs of these descriptive frameworks and encoding standards.\nAlas, I am not one of those archivists (**please keep this in mind as I try my best to explain below our understanding of archival data approaches). So in planning our grant, we spent some time consulting with standards documents and peer experts to ensure that the final dataset models repository locations data in a way that supports maintenance, reuse, and portability to other descriptive frameworks.\nCurrent archival descriptive practice seems somewhat inconclusive (or unemphatic, perhaps?) when it comes to encoding repository information. Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS) guidelines for encoding repository information are fairly remedial (see 2.2), suggesting only that an address and contact information may be \"desirable\". Section 5 of the International Standard for Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH) provides considerable guidance on describing a repository's name, parent institution, identifier, location, services, and mission. One noteworthy area of that section is 5.6 (Control Area), which suggests identifying the sources of your data and the dates of creation or revision (thanks to Mike Rush for pointing this out to us). ISDIAH, we learned, is now (or soon to be) considered superseded by the International Council on Archives' Records in Context (RiC), which treats repositories as Agents (corporate bodies). Aspects of ISDIAH have seemingly been translated to RiC's section 3, Properties of Entities -- specifically, 3.1 (for names and identifiers), 3.7 (for types of agents), 3.10 (for contact information) and 3.19 (\"Properties of Place\", which includes location information and even geographic coordinates.\nFor a real life example of how all this might translate to an Agent record in Encoded Archival Context (EAC), see below (thanks to Robbie Hott, who helpfully shared some data samples from the Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC) project):\n\nSomething not really addressed in these examples is the type of archival repository. As we've discussed, definitions of \"archive\" are hard to pin down, but it's something we've been trying to give attention to as we work through the data.\nBuilding on these descriptive approaches, we initially wanted to establish the following data on all repositories:\n\nRepository Name\nParent Institution Name\nAuthorized Name\nAuthorized Name Source\nRepository Identifier\nRepository Identifier Source\nLocation Type (e.g. Mailing Address, Street Address)\nStreet Address 1\nStreet Address 2\nCity\nState/Province\nZip Code\nCountry\nLongitude\nLatitude\nData Source\nDate of Entry\nName of Person Recording the Entry\n\nWe quickly realized that separately gathering authorized names and identifiers from a source like the Library of Congress's MARC organization codes would be too labor intensive. Longitude and latitude are absolutely critical pieces of data, but not something that was likely to be included in existing datasets. Instead of gathering that data now, our plan is auto-generate the geocoordinates using a service like Geocodio at the end of our project. We were also surprised (though probably should not have been) to discover that some data sources included both a mailing and street address for some repositories. In these cases, we have created two separate entries for the same repository, and created a new field in our data for \"location type\" to distinguish separate entries for the same repository.\n(Geocodio itself provides some interesting data considerations, including the concept of accuracy. For instance, it still generate coordinates for P.O. boxes, but encodes that location as a place rather than a point, and then provides an accuracy score. Geocodio also auto-generates county names, and normalizes address information, which will also come in handy for our project.)\nIn the end, our final dataset should bring together the name and location elements we've described here, aggregated into a single CSV file, which should lend itself to being migrated to other formats and integrated into other systems as needed. We'll also make the final data accessible through an Open Science Framework or Github repository so that others can continue the work we've begun. Other data sources will come to light, or repositories themselves may potentially find errors in our data that require updating. Ongoing maintenance will be required, which is why we hope this data can be stewarded by SAA once we're done. Regardless of the ultimate disposition, this should be data the community of archival professionals and related stakeholders can make use of in the future.\nAuthored by Ben Goldman\n\n",

The update times on this vary, but once a hurricane event is underway it is several times a day. According to NOAA, this layer \"depicts the geographical areas where inundation from storm surge could occur along with the heights, above ground, that water could reach in those areas.

Two versions of this graphic are provided in this map--one with a mask (depicted in gray) identifying Intertidal Zone/Estuarine Wetland areas, and another version without the mask where Intertidal Zone/Estuarine Wetland areas are symbolized with the same colors as other areas.\" You have to zoom in closer than the other layers to see this one display. This is Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLong Duration Hazardous Weather (explanation here).

    "content": "What is the RepoData Project?\n\nRepoData is short for “Repository Data” and refers to a project initiated by Ben Goldman, Penn State University, and Eira Tansey, University of Cincinnati, to locate, format and publish repository locations data for U.S.-based American archival repositories of primary source documents.\n\nAdditional information about the RepoData project can be found in our Open Science Foundation repository, as well as our project blog. Our last release of this data contained information for over 18,000 repositories, and has been made openly available via a Github repository.\n\nWhy should you care for and about RepoData?\n\nThis project began as an attempt to answer a seemingly simple question: Where can we find a comprehensive list of archival repositories in the United States? Our goal was to examine and better understand the vulnerabilities of American archives locations to the future impacts of climate change. While the archives profession does not maintain a comprehensive list of organizations and locations, we found that smaller aggregations of this data existed in disparate formats across numerous local, regional, and national groups, and so decided to pull it together.\n\nThis data has many potential utilities beyond understanding climate vulnerabilities. It can, for example, be used by researchers to identify and locate an archival repository. It can be utilized by professional archival associations to support an understanding of our professional community. It can be combined with other data sources in useful ways.\n\nTo continue having utility, this data must be maintained – improved, edited, expanded, iterated upon – and such maintenance requires a commitment of resources. It is our belief that this data serves the interests of the Society of American Archivists, “North America’s oldest and largest national professional association dedicated to the needs and interests of archives and archivists” and its members, and would be most sustainable and useful to the profession if maintained by them. Following is an overview of the data, suggested processes for maintaining it, and estimates for the labor required.\n\nWhat is being maintained?\n\nThe complete dataset is accessible as a single CSV file (data.csv), which is considered the canonical dataset. We have also made the data available as a json file (data.json).\n\nEach row of data in the CSV file represents a different repository address entry. In many instances, we gathered both street and mailing addresses for the same repository, and in such cases these were recorded in separate rows. Thus, while we recorded over 25,000 location entries in the dataset, we only identified ~18,000 unique repositories.\n\nA data dictionary is available HERE.\n\n…..\n",
