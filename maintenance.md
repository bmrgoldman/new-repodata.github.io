## What is the RepoData Project?

RepoData is short for “Repository Data” and refers to a project initiated by Ben Goldman, Penn State University, and Eira Tansey, University of Cincinnati, to locate, format and publish repository locations data for U.S.-based American archival repositories of primary source documents. 

Additional information about the RepoData project can be found in our Open Science Foundation repository, as well as our project blog. Our last release of this data contained information for over 18,000 repositories, and has been made openly available via a Github repository.

## Why should you care for and about RepoData?

This project began as an attempt to answer a seemingly simple question: Where can we find a comprehensive list of archival repositories in the United States? Our goal was to examine and better understand the vulnerabilities of American archives locations to the future impacts of climate change. While the archives profession does not maintain a comprehensive list of organizations and locations, we found that smaller aggregations of this data existed in disparate formats across numerous local, regional, and national groups, and so decided to pull it together. 

This data has many potential utilities beyond understanding climate vulnerabilities. It can, for example, be used by researchers to identify and locate an archival repository. It can be utilized by professional archival associations to support an understanding of our professional community. It can be combined with other data sources in useful ways.

To continue having utility, this data must be maintained -- improved, edited, expanded, iterated upon -- and such maintenance requires a commitment of resources. It is our belief that this data serves the interests of the Society of American Archivists, “North America's oldest and largest national professional association dedicated to the needs and interests of archives and archivists” and its members, and would be most sustainable and useful to the profession if maintained by them. Following is an overview of the data, suggested processes for maintaining it, and estimates for the labor required.

## What is being maintained?

The complete dataset is accessible as a single CSV file (data.csv), which is considered the canonical dataset. We have also made the data available as a json file (data.json). 

Each row of data in the CSV file represents a different repository address entry. In many instances, we gathered both street and mailing addresses for the same repository, and in such cases these were recorded in separate rows. Thus, while we recorded over 25,000 location entries in the dataset, we only identified ~18,000 unique repositories.
