    not sure if this is appropriate or if the data set is expandable, but the Austin
    Seminary Archives at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary (100 E 27th Street,
    Austin, TX 78705; www.austinseminary.edu/archives) is not included on your map,
    although we are listed in the TX data set. It may be the case that we were on
    your list but didn't meet the criteria for inclusion. If that is the case, please
    ignore, but if it helpful to add us to have a more complete picture of repositories
    in the US, then please add us in!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKristy<br
