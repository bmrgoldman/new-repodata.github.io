    <b>Name:</b> Steve Hausfeld<br /><br /><b>Email:</b> hausfes@nationwide.com<br /><br /><b>Website:</b> <br /><br /><b>Comment:</b> Ben, Eira and Whitney, I read with interest your article in the latest issue of Archival Outlook and I've spent some time here on your blog. I find this work really interesting and valuable. I work in a corporate archive setting in Ohio and am a past chair of the SAA Business Archives Section. When I read about your attempts at outreach to expand representation beyond the OCLC resource, I didn't see anything that jumped out at me showing you were able to gather data specifically on corporate/organizational archives. Did you gather evidence/location information for these types of repositories? There is a directory of corporate/organizational archives available through SAA if you aren't aware. I'm happy to talk with you further if you'd like. Thanks again for your work on this project. As I said, I definitely see value in exposing the breadth of archival repositories.<br /><br /><br /><hr />Time: June 6, 2018 at 12:34 pm<br />IP Address: 155.188.123.19<br />Contact Form URL: https://repositorydata.wordpress.com/contact/<br /><p>Sent by an unverified visitor to your site.</p>
