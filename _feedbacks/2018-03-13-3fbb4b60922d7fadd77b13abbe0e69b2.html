    for Preservation Week 2018, and I am wondering if some portion of your team would
    be interested and able to participate on April 26th? I think that the preservation

    />\r\n<br />\r\nThe idea is to provide a free and inclusive forum to share short
    \"presentations\" on topics related to preservation in libraries and archives.
    Each speaker would be assigned a session of 15 minutes to share 6-15 tweets/slides
    on a topic of their choosing. As one of the goals is to share useful knowledge,
    the talk doesn't have to be original or groundbreaking research. We hope that
    by clustering a number of sessions together that we can create some momentum to
    reach a broad audience with a range of topics, whether practical, project based,
    or theoretical.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are interested, just let me know and
