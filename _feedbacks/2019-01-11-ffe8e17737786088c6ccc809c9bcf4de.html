    am reaching out because I am a writing beginning work on a project about adaptation
    steps local municipalities are taking to confront climate change. I read the article
    in CityLab from a few months back about the threat to local archives which you
    were quoted about certain steps that are being -- or could be -- taken. The article
    was fascinating and the questions that it raises important. Do you have a sense
    of any specific communities that are taking specific steps based on the threats
    you have researched and reported on? If so, I would be very curious as to what
    communities those may be, what exactly they are doing to safeguard local archives,
    and what potentially unique challenges they may be confronting. Thank you in advance
    for any help or insight you may be able to offer me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the
    best,<br />\r\nNell Boeschenstein<br /><br /><br /><hr />Time: January 11, 2019
