    <b>Name:</b> Leah Geibel<br /><br /><b>Email:</b> leah.geibel@alaska.gov<br /><br /><b>Website:</b> <br /><br /><b>Comment:</b> Hello!  Just wanted to say what a fantastic resource this project has created!  I see the project is coming to a close, but I was wondering if in the future, the map can be added to as new archives arise/information about them is found?  For instance, the Alaska State Archives are not on the map - our fellow State Library Historical Collections are listed, but we hold very different records.  I know it'd be impossible to document every repository but I was just curious if this map is a final version or if it's intended to grow over time?  Thank you!<br /><br /><br /><hr />Time: October 31, 2019 at 7:08 pm<br />IP Address: 158.145.240.113<br />Contact Form URL: https://repositorydata.wordpress.com/contact/<br /><p>Sent by an unverified visitor to your site.</p>
